# Cryptocurrencies

## Background:

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

Project Overview: 

The data we are working with is not ideal so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. There is no known output for what Accountability Accounting are seeking so we have decided to use unsupervised machine learning. Martha from Accountability Accounting has decided to use a clustering algorithm to group the currencies and many data visualizations to share our findings with the board of the company.
